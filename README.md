## Abstract
 
Link prediction is a common task on graph-structured data that has seen applications in a variety of domains. Classically, hand-crafted heuristics were used for this task. Heuristic measures are chosen such that they correlate well with the underlying factors related to link formation. In recent years, a new class of methods has emerged that combines the advantages of message-passing neural networks (MPNN) and heuristics methods. These methods perform predictions by using the output of an MPNN in conjunction with a "pairwise encoding" that captures the relationship between nodes in the candidate link. They have been shown to achieve strong performance on numerous datasets. However, current pairwise encodings often contain a strong  inductive bias, using the same underlying factors to classify all links. This limits the ability of existing methods to learn how to properly classify a variety of different links that may form from different factors. To address this limitation, we propose a new method, LPFormer, which attempts to adaptively learn the pairwise encodings for each link. LPFormer models the link factors via an attention module that learns the pairwise encoding that exists between nodes by modeling multiple factors integral to link prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LPFormer can achieve SOTA performance on numerous datasets while maintaining efficiency.


## Requirements

All experiments were run using python 3.9.13.

The required python packages can be installed via the  `requirements.txt` file.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Data

The data for Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Juanhui28/HeaRT#download-data). The data should correspondingly be placed in a directory called `dataset` in the root project directory. The data for the OGB datasets are downloaded automatically from the `ogb` package.

## Reproduce Results


<!-- ### Compute PPR Matrices

Before being able to reproduce the results, you must calculate the PPR matrices for each dataset. This can be done for each dataset by running:
```
bash scripts/calc_ppr_matrices.sh
```
The parameter `--eps` controls the approximation accuracy. If you'd like a better (or worse) approximation of the PPR scores, please adjust `--eps` accordingly. Please note that for larger datasets, a very lower epsilon may take a very long time to run and will result in a large file saved to the disk. -->


### Reproduce the Paper Results

The commands for reproducing the results on the existing setting in the paper are in the `scripts/replicate_existing.sh` file. For the HeaRT setting, they are in `scripts/replicate_heart.sh`. Please note that for the ogbl-citation2 and ogbl-ddi, over 32GB of GPU memory is required to train the model.  


### Running Yourself

1. To add a new dataset, you'll need to add a custom function in `src/util/read_datasets.py`. Then add the option to call that function in `run_model` in `src/run.py`.
2. When computing the PPR matrix, the parameter `--eps` controls the approximation accuracy. If you'd like a better (or worse) approximation of the PPR scores, please adjust `--eps` accordingly. Please note that for larger datasets, a very lower epsilon may take a very long time to run and will result in a large file saved to the disk.
3. The list of hyperparameters can be found by looking at one of the sample commands in either `scripts/replicate_existing.sh` or `scripts/replicate_heart.sh`.
